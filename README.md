# CNN Prediction Model on AAPL Stock-Prices: Project Overview
* Transform and preprocess data for convolution model
* Train and test Apple stock data onto the model
* Adjust sequential model until optimal loss and RMSE is achieved
* Plot prediction results on test data and future results
* **Main Packages:** pandas, numpy, sklearn, keras, yfinance

During the pandemic, I became invensted learning about stocks like all my other friends. I wanted to use my statistical modeling skills and try predicting the next day's stock price. Although stock prices are unpredictable, I wanted to try making this project to further learn more about convolutional neural networks and see how close I could get to predicting stock data. In this project, I used AAPL stock price data from yahoo finance. 

Shown below is a comparison to the AAPL stock prices to the predicted stock prices from my convolutional neural network.

## What I Learned:
* Learning about the yfinance package
* Understanding preparation steps to transforming data for convolution models
* Deeper understanding of basic convolutional neural networks (cnn) on time series
* Predicting data with a cnn model
